This is the front-end for our school's tech committee - [Team CodeTech](https://teamcodetech.in). This project is currently a work-in-progress and is being actively worked on by the entire team. 

This time, instead of using any fancy frameworks, I figured that it might be a better idea to simply create the website with vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JS along with JQuery. As most of the members are quite familiar with them and is easier to work with.
