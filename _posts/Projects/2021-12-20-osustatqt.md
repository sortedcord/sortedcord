A lightweight desktop application to show you information about plays, scores and beatmaps. Basically a simple osu-web client.

Having invested a lot of time into a rhythm-game called "osu", I wanted to try and make a statistics application for the same which worked by using the multiplayer API that osu provides.

This is the first project which was a desktop application, especially built with PyQt5. Slots, connections and multithreading are some concepts I learnt from this project.
